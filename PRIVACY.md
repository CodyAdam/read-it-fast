# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Introduction

Read It Fast ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our browser extension.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data or browsing information.**

Read It Fast operates entirely locally on your device. The extension:

- Does not collect any personal information
- Does not track your browsing activity
- Does not transmit data to external servers
- Does not use analytics or tracking services
- Does not share data with third parties

## Local Storage

The extension uses the browser's local storage API to save your preferences and settings. This data includes:

- Reading speed (words per minute)
- Display settings (scale, colors)
- Hotkey configurations
- Timing preferences

**All settings are stored locally on your device and never leave your browser.** You can clear this data at any time by uninstalling the extension or clearing your browser's extension storage.

## Permissions

Read It Fast requires the following permissions:

### Storage Permission

- **Purpose:** To save your extension settings and preferences locally
- **Data:** Only your configuration settings (reading speed, colors, hotkeys, etc.)
- **Location:** Stored locally in your browser, never transmitted

### Content Script Access

- **Purpose:** To extract and display text from webpages for RSVP reading
- **Data:** Text is processed locally in your browser only
- **Transmission:** No text data is collected, stored, or transmitted

## How We Use Information

The extension processes text from webpages you visit **only for the purpose of displaying it in the RSVP reading interface**. This processing happens entirely on your device:

- Text is extracted from the webpage DOM
- Text is displayed word-by-word in the extension's interface
- No text is saved, logged, or transmitted

## Data Sharing

**We do not share, sell, or disclose any data to third parties.** Since we don't collect any data, there is nothing to share.

## Third-Party Services

Read It Fast does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or external APIs. The extension operates completely offline and locally.

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control:

- **Access:** View your settings in the extension popup
- **Modify:** Change your settings at any time
- **Delete:** Uninstall the extension or clear browser storage to remove all data

## Children's Privacy

Read It Fast does not knowingly collect information from children. Since we don't collect any information, this is not applicable.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.
